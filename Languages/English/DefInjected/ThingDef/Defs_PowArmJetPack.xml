  <Apparel_PowArmJetPack.description>A suit of light powered armor equipped with a jet pack. Layered plasteel-weave plates are very effective at stopping attacks, with few vulnerable joint sections. Neuro-memetic assistors allow a human to wear the armor and still move easily.\n\nArmor like this is often used by imperial janissaries and rapid-incursion space marines.</Apparel_PowArmJetPack.description>
